It is a simple Android application for quickly calculating the dew point using the Magnus-Tetens formula approximation. Developed only for learning purposes. This application provides a basic assessment of condensation risk based on the difference between the current temperature and the calculated dew point. In our requirement, a difference above 4.5°C is considered good, a difference above 3°C is moderate (acceptable during shutdown), and a difference below 3°C indicates a high risk of condensation. These thresholds can be easily modified to suit your application requirements.
